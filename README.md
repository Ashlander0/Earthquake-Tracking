Tracking the occurance of earthquakes around the world over the last 30 days.

All earthquakes within the previous 30 days are represented by a circle marker on the map, and provide various details about the occurance. The depth of the earthquake is displayed by the shade of red, with darker shades representing earthquakes with deeper sources (as shown by the legend). The magnitude is also displayed by the size of each marker, with larger markers indicating a higher magnitude.
